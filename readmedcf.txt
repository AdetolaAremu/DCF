I created an end to end E-FORM that will pave way for paperless transactions/requests for customers that wants to change thier data/information.
The E-Form is a replica of what we call DATA CORRECTION FORM in Leadway Pensure PFA.
The E-form also has a page for attachments of supporting documents such as affidavit, newspaper publication etc
I also created a dashboard of PENDING, REJECT and APPROVED for team members and supervisors so they can process these e-forms accordingly.

NOTE: This project was built on the new BOOTSTRAP 5 ALPHA version.
